## 1.What is RShiny?

RShiny is an open-source web application framework written in R for developing web applications.
It's designed to create interactive, web-based dashboards, data visualizations, and interactive web applications without requiring
extensive knowledge of web development languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
It was announced by Joe Cheng, CTO of Pozit (formerly RStudio), in 2012.

## 2.What are the benefits of using RShiny?

It is easy to use, even for users with no prior experience in web development.
It provides a number of built-in features that make it easy to create interactive web applications.
It is scalable, so you can create Shiny apps of any size or complexity.
It is open source, so there is a large community of users and developers who can help you if you need assistance.

## 3.What is the basic structure of R Shiny Applicaton?

A Shiny application consists of two main parts: a user interface (UI) and a server. The UI defines the layout and appearance, while the 
server defines the app's behavior and functionality.

## 4.What is the difference between ui and server functions in Shiny?

The UI function in Shiny constructs the user interface, specifying layout and appearance elements such as inputs, outputs, and formatting. On the other hand, the server function houses the application's logic and reactive behavior, handling input changes, calculations, and dynamic updates of output based on user interactions or other data modifications.
The UI sets up the visual structure, while the server controls the dynamic functionality, enabling a seamless interactive experience for users.

## 5.What is reactivity in R Shiny?
Reactivity in R Shiny refers to the ability of a Shiny app to automatically update outputs (e.g., plots, tables) based on changes in inputs, reactive expressions, or other reactive values. It ensures that the app stays responsive and reflects the most current state based on user actions.

## 6.What is reactive expression in the context of R Shiny?

A reactive expression is an expression that returns a value that can change over time in response to user input or other events. Reactive expressions are used to create reactive values, which are values that can change over time.
In Shiny, reactive expressions are used to create reactive values that can be used to update the output of a Shiny app in response to user input or other events.

## 7.What is the concept of reactive graph in R Shiny?
A reactive graph in R Shiny is a visual representation of how various reactive components (reactive expressions, reactive values) are connected and 
depend on each other. It helps in understanding the flow of reactivity within the application, aiding in optimizing and debugging the app's performance.

## 8.What is the difference between a reactive expression and a reactive value?
A reactive expression is a function that returns a value, and a reactive value is a variable that can be changed. Reactive expressions 
are used to calculate values that depend on other reactive values or input values. Reactive values are used to store values that need to 
be updated when other reactive values or input values change.
