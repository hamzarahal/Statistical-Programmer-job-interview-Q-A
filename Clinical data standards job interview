Q2- What sort of information do you find in the AE dataset and what exactly is the purpose of the same?

Its stands for Adverse Events. It provides useful information regarding the subject code, subject matter, and generally it contains all 
the relevant codes in the module. In addition o this, it offers users the information of the events as well as on the severity of the same.
